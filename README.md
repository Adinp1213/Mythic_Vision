<h1> Mythic_Vision </h1>

The
"Mythic Vision
"
software is an innovative and
socially impactful capstone project aimed at
enhancing the cultural experience of tourists in
India. The project seeks to develop a deep
learning-based software solution that can detect
and classify representations of Indian deities
present in cultural artifacts, sculptures, and
artworks.

By providing accurate and informative insights into Indian
mythology, the software aims to empower tourists with a
deeper understanding of the rich cultural heritage and
traditions of India, thereby enriching their overall tourism
experience.
In the context of India
'
s unique position as a global tourism hub, where millions of visitors
are captivated by its diverse landscapes, traditions, and history, there exists a significant
gap in tourists awareness of the richness of Indian mythology. The comprehensive
literature survey conducted indicates a remarkable absence of any prior work or software
that aligns with the vision and objectives of "Mythic Vision
". However, there has a been a
similar project named "Traditional chinese god image dataset: A glimpse of chinese
culture
"
which was developed in China for their culture but nothing when it comes to
Indian mythology.
Hence, our project represents a groundbreaking innovation. The synthesis of advanced
deep learning techniques with the delicate details of Indian mythology will revolutionize
the way tourists engage with and appreciate cultural heritage, offering an unprecedented
opportunity for exploration, education, and meaningful cultural exchange.

<h2> Objective </h2>
The main goal of our project is to create a special computer program that can help
people who visit India to learn about its ancient stories and gods more easily.
Eliminate the need for tourists to hire expensive guides by offering a reliable and
informative digital guide through the software.
Enhance tourists overall cultural experience in India by enabling them to connect more
deeply with the history and stories behind the art and artifacts they encounter.
Contribute to the well-being of local communities by ensuring that tourists receive
accurate information and fostering a positive and educational tourism experience.
