# Mythic_Vision

The
"Mythic Vision
"
software is an innovative and
socially impactful capstone project aimed at
enhancing the cultural experience of tourists in
India. The project seeks to develop a deep
learning-based software solution that can detect
and classify representations of Indian deities
present in cultural artifacts, sculptures, and
artworks.

By providing accurate and informative insights into Indian
mythology, the software aims to empower tourists with a
deeper understanding of the rich cultural heritage and
traditions of India, thereby enriching their overall tourism
experience.
In the context of India
'
s unique position as a global tourism hub, where millions of visitors
are captivated by its diverse landscapes, traditions, and history, there exists a significant
gap in tourists awareness of the richness of Indian mythology. The comprehensive
literature survey conducted indicates a remarkable absence of any prior work or software
that aligns with the vision and objectives of "Mythic Vision
". However, there has a been a
similar project named "Traditional chinese god image dataset: A glimpse of chinese
culture
"
which was developed in China for their culture but nothing when it comes to
Indian mythology.
Hence, our project represents a groundbreaking innovation. The synthesis of advanced
deep learning techniques with the delicate details of Indian mythology will revolutionize
the way tourists engage with and appreciate cultural heritage, offering an unprecedented
opportunity for exploration, education, and meaningful cultural exchange.
